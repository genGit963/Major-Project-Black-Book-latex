\chapter{Applications}
The voice-controlled robot with a computer vision-based robotic arm project offers several practical applications across different domains. Here are some potential applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The robot can be integrated into a smart home system to control lights, thermostats, and other IoT devices based on voice commands and visual cues.
    \item Educational institutions can use the project to teach students about robotics, computer vision, and voice recognition technologies.
    \item In emergency situations, the robot can be deployed to search for survivors in disaster zones, providing real-time feedback to rescue teams and assisting in the retrieval of objects or individuals.
    \item Planetary rover exploration.
    
\end{itemize}
