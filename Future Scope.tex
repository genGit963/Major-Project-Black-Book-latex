\chapter{Future Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item More sophisticated computer vision algorithms can be implemented to enable identification of wider range of a object.
    \item The size and strength of the robotic arm can be increased for industrial applications.
    \item Natural language processing techniques to enhance the voice recognition capabilities can e integrated. 
    \item Sensors and mapping techniques can be used for the robot to navigate autonomously in its environment. 
    \item More intuitive and natural interfaces for human-robot interaction can be researched and developed.
